          | Robot Academy is an educational platform meant to teach the fundamentals of robotics simulation through a user-friendly and intuitive video lab environment. Robotics simulation through the software CopelliaSim offers users free access to robotics development software. Labs consist of short, bite-sized video lessons with resources such as code snippets and the ability to ask for help from the community that will ensure the students of our platform will always be able to keep up with the material. Robot Academy is geared towards students of a variety of ages and skill levels.

            p.p-3 The robot simulator CoppeliaSim, with integrated development environment, is based on a distributed control architecture: each object/model can be individually controlled via an embedded script, a plugin, a ROS or BlueZero node, a remote API client, or a custom solution. This makes CoppeliaSim very versatile and ideal for multi-robot applications. Controllers can be written in C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Octave. CoppeliaSim is used for fast algorithm development, factory automation simulations, fast prototyping and verification, robotics related education, remote monitoring, safety double-checking, as digital twin, and much more.

        |         The purpose of this application is to allow anyone with the desire to learn robotics simulation an entry-point into this field without any requisite knowledge about it. It will also provide an entry-point for those without the means to pursue higher education in this field or the capital to expend on some of the more expensive robotics learning applications currently on the market.
        |         Robotics education through robotics simulation will allow those without access to physical robotics hardware to get started using this platform. Children will also be able to use our platform due to its simple interface and accessibility. Robotics education has been proven to increase standardizes testing scores in children and it is important dhat Robot Academy include this audience[REFERENCE]. Youth education of robotics teaches the fundamentals of engineering design, programming, and offers an introduction to the STEM field.
